// About text for Wes

export default 'Hi, thanks for visiting my site and taking the time to learn some more about me. I\'m a passionate fullstack software engineer with over 14 years of professional engineering experience and 7 years of engineering management experience.<br><br>I have worked in-depth across the stack, with the goal of creating impactful experiences in whatever project I am a part of. I have led teams in developing feature-rich client-side applications across a number of JavaScript frameworks (React / Redux, Angular, Backbone, etc), and I enjoy creating applications that provide an excellent user experience, both functionally and visually.<br><br>On the server side, I have led teams in architecting and developing highly-performant, resilient, and scalable cloud-based distributed applications and services. The applications I have been a part of building have served millions of users in production environments and dealt with processing millions of events per second at extremely low latencies. I have extensive experience in identifying critical bottlenecks in performance in both client and server applications and implementing performance test scenarios, metrics, logging, and alerting infrastructure as well.<br><br>In the last 7 years, I have delved into the blockchain / crypto space and dedicated my time to learning the core principles of decentralized applications, focused mainly on the Ethereum ecosystem and layer 2 chains, though I have spent time learning and developing on other chains as well. I believe strongly in the fundamentals of decentralized and permissionless systems that enable users beyond the existing traditional financial and/or other centralized systems, and I hope to play a part in democratizing access to applications and services once previously reserved for institutions or individuals with greater credentials and/or wealth.<br><br>As both a user and developer in Web3, I am focused on the long-term evolution and sustainability of these protocols and dapps that will hopefully change the way that we think about our online presence and return ownership and control back to the individual.';
